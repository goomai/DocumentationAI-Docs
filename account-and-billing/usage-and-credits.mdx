## What Counts Toward Your Usage

Understanding how usage is tracked helps you maximize your subscription value.

### Web Interface Usage

Any feature you use directly on the HumanizeAI website counts toward your monthly limits:

- Humanization checks

- Plagiarism detection

- AI content detection

- AI writing and editing

- Article generation

### API Usage

API calls share the same monthly limits as web interface usage:

- REST API requests

- Programmatic access to all features

- Batch processing operations

## When You Need More Capacity

If you regularly approach or exceed your limits:

- **Upgrade Your Plan**: Higher tiers offer significantly more capacity across all features.

- **Consider Annual Billing**: Get more value with annual subscriptions (typically 20-30% savings).

- **Use API Strategically**: Batch process content during off-peak usage times.

## Usage Reset and Renewal

### How Limits Reset

Your usage limits refresh automatically:

- **Reset Date**: Aligns with your billing cycle start date

- **Full Restoration**: All limits return to 100% of your plan allowance

- **No Rollover**: Unused capacity doesn't carry over to the next period

### Tracking Your Reset Date

Find your next reset date in two locations:

- **Usage Dashboard**: Displays countdown to next reset

- **Billing Page**: Shows your next billing/renewal date

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **What happens if I exceed my limit?**

When you reach your monthly limit for any feature, that feature becomes temporarily unavailable until your billing period resets. You can upgrade your plan anytime for immediate restored access.

### **Can I purchase additional credits mid-cycle?**

Currently, upgrading your plan is the best way to increase limits. Upgrades take effect immediately and provide higher limits for the remainder of your billing period.

### **Do API and web usage share the same limits?**

Yes, both API calls and web interface usage count toward your total monthly word allowance. This ensures fair usage across all access methods.

### **How accurate is the usage tracking?**

Usage tracking is real-time and updates immediately after each operation. The dashboard reflects your current usage within seconds.
