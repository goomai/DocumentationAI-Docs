## Managing Your Usage Effectively

### Tips for Staying Within Limits

**Monitor Regularly**: Check your usage dashboard weekly to avoid surprises.

**Plan Ahead**: For large projects, estimate word count needs in advance.

**Optimize Content**: Edit and refine text before humanization to reduce word count.

**Use Per-Check Limits Wisely**: Break longer content into optimal chunks for best results.

### When You Need More Capacity

If you regularly approach or exceed your limits:

**Upgrade Your Plan**: Higher tiers offer significantly more capacity across all features.

**Consider Annual Billing**: Get more value with annual subscriptions (typically 20-30% savings).

**Use API Strategically**: Batch process content during off-peak usage times.

Your usage limits refresh automatically:

- **Reset Date**: Aligns with your billing cycle start date

- **Full Restoration**: All limits return to 100% of your plan allowance

### Tracking Your Reset Date

Find your next reset date in two locations:

- **Billing Page**: Shows your next billing/renewal date
