## How it works

**Most AI tools just generate random content.** Our agent follows the exact same process that successful content marketers use:

**Step 1: Deep Competitor Analysis** Before writing anything, our AI analyzes your top-ranking competitors to understand:

- What content structure actually works in your space

- Which topics and angles are missing opportunities

- What tone and style converts in your industry

**Step 2: Strategic Keyword Research** We don't just find basic keywords. Our AI identifies:

- **Entities** (people, places, concepts that establish authority)

- **People Also Ask questions** (perfect for featured snippets)

- **People Also Search For terms** (expanding your reach)

- **Related keywords** (building topical depth)

**Step 3: Optimized Content Structure** Our AI creates outlines that are optimized for both SEO and AEO:

- Strategic heading placement for search engines

- Answer blocks designed to win featured snippets

- Content structure that appears in ChatGPT and Gemini responses

**Step 4: Research-Backed Writing** Finally, our AI writes the actual content using:

- Real research and data (not generic fluff)

- Natural, human-like flow and voice

- Strategic keyword integration that reads naturally

- Content that directly answers what people are searching for

**The result?** Content that's optimized for both traditional search engines AND answer engines like ChatGPT, while sounding authentically human.

## How to generate article

1. **Collect inputs** — topic, project, article type, tone, country, citation preferences, and your optional notes.

2. **Confirm P1** — lock an existing primary keyword or pick from suggestions.

3. **Generate title & outline** — creates H1 and a logically ordered H2/H3 structure with suggested FAQs and word budgets.

4. **Draft by section** — writes each section to your tone/length; you can edit or regenerate any part.

5. **Final pass** — applies humanization, runs structural checks, and prepares export.
