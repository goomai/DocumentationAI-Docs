title: AI Detector
---
The AI Detector analyzes your text and provides a score indicating whether it appears to be written by a human or AI. Perfect for verifying the authenticity of your content before publishing, submitting assignments, or sharing professionally.

## How It Works

Simply paste or type your content into the text area and click **Check AI Detection**. The tool analyzes writing patterns, sentence structure, and language characteristics to determine how human-like your content sounds.

### **Understanding Your Score**

The AI detector provides a visual scoring meter with color-coded results showing how human-like your content appears.

| Result               | Score Range | Interpretation                              |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **ðŸŸ¢ Human-written** | **0-35%**   | Natural writing patterns detected           |
| **ðŸŸ¡ Likely Human**  | **36-50%**  | Some AI patterns but mostly natural writing |
| **ðŸŸ  Likely AI**     | **51-65%**  | Strong AI patterns with some human elements |
| **ðŸ”´ AI-generated**  | **66-100%** | Clear artificial writing patterns detected  |

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Add Your Content**

   1. **Paste Text:** Copy and paste content from any source (documents, websites, emails)

   2. **Type Directly:** Write or edit text directly in the detection area

   3. **Use Formatting:** Apply headers, lists, or other formatting as needed

2. Click the **âš¡ Check AI Detection** button to analyze your content. The analysis typically takes a few seconds.

3. **Review Results**

   1. **Visual Meter:** Color-coded scoring meter from green (human) to red (AI-generated)

   2. **Score & Message:** Clear percentage and interpretation of your results

   3. **Detailed Analysis:** Understanding of what the score means for your content

## Common Use Cases

- **Students:&#x20;**&#x43;heck essays and assignments to ensure they sound authentic and reflect your personal writing voice.

- **Content Creators:&#x20;**&#x56;erify blog posts, articles, and marketing content maintain engaging, human-like qualities that connect with readers.

- **Professionals:&#x20;**&#x52;eview business documents, reports, and communications to ensure they sound professional yet personable.

- **Editors:&#x20;**&#x51;uality-check content from multiple writers to maintain consistent, authentic voice across publications.

## Best Practices

- **Content Length:&#x20;**&#x55;se at least 100-200 words for more accurate detection. Very short text may not provide reliable results.

- **Multiple Checks:&#x20;**&#x49;f you make revisions to improve your score, run detection again to see if changes helped.

- **Context Matters:&#x20;**&#x52;emember that some topics or writing styles naturally score higher (technical writing, formal documents) while others score lower (personal narratives, conversational content).

- **Use as a Guide:&#x20;**&#x41;I detection is a tool to help improve your writing, not a definitive judgment. Focus on creating content that serves your audience effectively.

## Understanding Detection Limitations

### **What AI Detection Does Well**

- Identifies common AI writing patterns and structures

- Detects repetitive or formulaic language

- Recognizes lack of personal voice or authentic details

### **What AI Detection Can't Do**

- Guarantee 100% accuracy (no detector is perfect)

- Account for individual writing styles that may naturally seem formal

- Distinguish between well-edited human writing and good AI content

### **Important Considerations**

- Different detectors may give different results

- Scores can vary based on topic, audience, and writing style

- Detection technology continues to evolve as AI writing improves
