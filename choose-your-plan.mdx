## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Does the Academic Plan include the AI Article Generator Agent?**

No, the AI article generator agent is exclusive to the Marketing Plan.

### **Will the upcoming tools (Content Optimizer, AEO Tracker, Site Audit) be available in the Marketing Plan?**

Yes, these features are being developed specifically for the Marketing Plan. We'll share exact details and usage limits when they launch.

### **Can I switch plans later?**

Absolutely. You can change your plan anytime. For specific billing details, check out our Account & Billing section.

### **Will Humanize AI pass every AI detector?**

We pass most major AI detectors, including GPTZero, Quillbot, and Grammarly. However, we prioritize natural, readable content over gaming detection systems.¬†AI detectors aren't 100% accurate and often disagree with each other. If we tried to bypass every detector, the content would become awkward and unreadable. Our approach focuses on making content sound genuinely human for your audience, which naturally reduces AI-like signals while keeping your writing clear and effective.
