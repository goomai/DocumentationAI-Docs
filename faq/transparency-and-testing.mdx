title: Transparency and Testing
---
We want to be transparent about how Humanize AI performs and how we test it. Humanize offers two rewrite modes:

- **Balanced** — preserves your natural tone and style while reducing AI‑detector scores. In our internal tests, we aim to keep scores under \~30% on commonly used detectors.

- **Ultra** — stronger transformation for the lowest detector scores, while keeping meaning intact.

## Detectors we monitor

We regularly check results against four widely used detectors:

1. **GPTZero** — [gptzero.me](http://gptzero.me)

2. **QuillBot AI Detector** — [quillbot.com](http://quillbot.com)

3. **ZeroGPT** — [zerogpt.com](http://zerogpt.com)

4. **Grammarly** — [grammarly.com](http://grammarly.com)

## Latest results (as of 1 Sep 2025)

*Arithmetic means across the 20 topics provided; detectors: ZeroGPT, QuillBot, Grammarly, GPTZero.*

| Detector      | Raw AI (baseline) | Humanize — Ultra | Humanize — Balanced |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| **ZeroGPT**   | 99.76%            | 8.51%            | 18.60%              |
| **QuillBot**  | 95.85%            | 5.50%            | 24.65%              |
| **Grammarly** | 73.60%            | 5.00%            | 9.10%               |
| **GPTZero**   | 92.85%            | 4.75%            | 26.85%              |

**Notes**

- These are simple averages over 20 topics; your mileage may vary by text, topic, and detector version.

- Detector vendors update models and thresholds; scores can change over time.
