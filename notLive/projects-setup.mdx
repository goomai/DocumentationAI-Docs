## Best Practices for Project Setup

### **Website URL Tips**

- Use your main domain URL including https\://

- For blogs on subdomains, use the specific subdomain (e.g., blog.yoursite.com)

- If you have multiple related sites, create separate projects for each

### **Writing Effective Brand Tone Descriptions**

Be specific about how you want to sound. Avoid generic terms:

**Instead of:** "Professional and friendly"\
**Try:** "Professional yet approachable, like an expert consultant explaining complex topics to busy executives"

**Instead of:** "Casual"\
**Try:** "Conversational and relatable, like talking to a knowledgeable friend who keeps things simple"

### Writing Effective Project Descriptions

Write a clear paragraph describing your website, products, and target audience. Include what your company does, who you serve, and your main features or services. The AI uses this to create relevant content that accurately represents your business.

### **Brand Terms Strategy**

Include your most important terms that you want the AI to use naturally in your content. Add your actual product names and features, industry-specific terminology your audience uses, key phrases or concepts you're known for, business acronyms, and alternative names people might search for when looking for solutions like yours.
